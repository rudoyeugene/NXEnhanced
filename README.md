<h1 align="center">NX Enhanced</h1>
<p align="center">Adds "quality-of-life" features to NextDNS website to make the experience of managing lists, domains, logs, etc. more practical. </p>
<h3 align="center">âš  It's a fork, no huge changes planned, just tiny ones to keep Google satisfied.</h6>

## Current features

### Logs page:

- Allow/Deny buttons in the logs that make it possible to add an exception or block a domain without needing to copy, switch pages, and paste.

    ![Allow and Deny butttons](https://i.imgur.com/3XNMUi1.png)    
You can either add the respective domain or the whole root domain, or even edit the domain if you want.

- Ability to specify domains that should be hidden from the logs

    You can either manually input domains, or click on the "Hide" button, alongside the Allow/Deny buttons, which lets you hide domains with few clicks.  [Read more](https://github.com/hjk789/NXEnhanced/wiki#ability-to-specify-domains-that-should-be-hidden-from-the-logs)

## How to install

Click the button above that matches your browser, install then confirm installation. If you are using a Chromium-based browser, like Brave, Opera, Vivaldi, and others, use the Chrome Web Store link.

You also have the option of using the userscript version, but it works only in Chrome, in Firefox it works partially. Also, keep in mind that the userscript is discontinued, so it won't receive any updates. For more information and instructions, read [here](https://github.com/hjk789/NXEnhanced/tree/master/Userscript#how-to-use-it).

NX Enhanced was tested in Firefox and Chrome. It should work fine in pretty much any browser that accepts Firefox or Chrome extensions, although I didn't tested them.
